          Organizations welcoming employees back on-premises must take care to do so safely. Whether your company is adapting to a semi- or permanent hybrid environment, employee safety during the transition is critical for organizations that want to retain talent
          and reinforce a culture of empathy and understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Show your employees you’re putting their health and well-being first by carefully considering how you’ll bring them back into the physical spaces within your office.

          How many employees should you plan for to be on-premises simultaneously while trying to maintain safe operations? Try this Safety Occupancy Calculator tool based on the most current Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) mandatory safety
          and health standards, to calculate recommended safe distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this calculator, you can estimate the recommended amount of space each office employee will need in any given shared space—putting one more layer of safety and protection around your employees as they return to work.

          <b>Disclaimer:</b> Kastle developed this calculator based on the most current recommended safe distances from OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration). This tool is meant to help each user get a sense for recommended personal safe
          distance in an office. This should not be used to calculate how many people can comfortably fit into specific spaces such as office bathrooms, break rooms, shared desk spaces, and more as each office space varies in square footage.
